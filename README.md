# Number-Guessing-Game
Coursework #2 of my MSc programming module

We were asked to implement a Python program that plays the number guessing
game. The user thinks of a number within a given interval (e.g. 1 - 100), but
does not input anything to the program; Your program should ask questions to
the user to know whether the number is less than, equal or greater than another
number. The user will be able to give inputs only in the form of <, = or >.
The goal is to guess the answer with as few steps as possible.
