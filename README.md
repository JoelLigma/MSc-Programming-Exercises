# MSc Programming Coursework

Coursework #2: Ex02

We were asked to implement a Python program that plays the number guessing
game. The user thinks of a number within a given interval (e.g. 1 - 100), but
does not input anything to the program; Your program should ask questions to
the user to know whether the number is less than, equal or greater than another
number. The user will be able to give inputs only in the form of <, = or >.
The goal is to guess the answer with as few steps as possible. 

Coursework #3: Ex03

We were asked to implement a Python function that solves the 8 queens puzzle.
The 8 queens puzzle consists of placing 8 queens on a chess board, so that, none
of the queens could capture any other. Note that queens can move orthogonally
or diagonally in any direction. We should implement a function called solve()
that when called, it prints the first solution of the puzzle and then it waits 
for input. Once the user presses “enter”, the next solution is printed and so on.
